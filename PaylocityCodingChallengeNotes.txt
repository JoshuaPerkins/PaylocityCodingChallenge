- Project Overview:
 - 26 paychecks / year
 - Employees paid $2000 / paycheck
   - $2000*26 = x pay per year = $52000
 - cost of benefits is $1000 / year / employee
   - $1000/26 paychecks = x per check = 38.46 + (one added deduction of $0.04)
 - cost of dependents is $500 / year / dependent
   - $500/26 paychecks = x per check per dependent = 19.23 + (one added deduction of $0.02)

 - Discount (if name starts with 'A') is 10% (employee or dependent) (I will interpret this to mean FirstName)

- Classes:
 - EMPLOYEE = {
		FirstName: String
		LastName: String
		Dependents: Array of Dependents
		***Pay: Pay object
	}

 - DEPENDENT = {
		Name: String
	}

 - PAY = {
		Paychecks_Per_Year: Integer
		Pay_Per_Paycheck: Float
	}

Variables:
 - EMPLOYEE_BENEFIT_COST = $1000 (year)
 - DEPENDENT_BENEFIT_COST = $500 (year)
 - GROSS_PAY = $2000 (paycheck)
 - PAYCHECKS_YEAR = 26
 - DISCOUNT_LETTER = 'a'
